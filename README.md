# mcassoc

mcassoc is a free service that allows you to add Minecraft account association to your site or forums. By using skins to verify association, users don't need to provide account details to 3rd-party sites and once they've signed up once they simply need to enter their separate mcassoc credentials if they wish to associate on a future site.

Integration is simple and sample code is available in both PHP and Python.
